# Real-Time-Object-Detection

Utilizing Deep Learning for Object Recognition and Tracking in Aerial Images/Videos: A YOLO-DeepSort Approach integrated with OpenCV, Flask API, and React interface.

## Get started with Flask API

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/YassineOuhadi/Real-Time-Object-Detection.git`
   
1. Navigate to the root directory of the application:

   `cd flask-api`
   
1. Install required packages:

   `pip install -U pip virtualenv`
   `pip install flask`
   `pip install ultralytics`
   `pip install opencv-python`
   
1. Create a virtual environment:

   `python -m venv venv`
   
1. Activate the virtual environment:

   `source venv/bin/activate`
   
1. Run the Flask application:

   `python -m flask --app ./app.py run`
   
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `pip install ultralytics
   
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `pip install opencv-python`
   
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   `python -m flask --app ./app.py run`
   
## Get started with React Interface

To run this application in `http://localhost:3000/`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the application:

   `cd react-app`

1. Install dependencies:

   `npm install`
   
1. Install client dependencies:

   `cd client`
   `npm install`
   
1. Run the application:

   `cd ..`
   `npm run dev`
